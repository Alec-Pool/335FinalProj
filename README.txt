App Description:
My app does 3 things:
1) You can signup, and the credentials are saved in MongoDB
2) You can login, and the credentials are querried in MongoDB
3) It displays launch data from the most recent SpaceX mission using the SpaceX API https://api.spacexdata.com/v5/launches/latest

Teh application uses Node and Express, and is styled with CSS.

The application was deployed to Cyclic, but there are bugs with the API and Mongo due to Cyclic. All required features work perfectly on localhost. I tried debugging this issue for 6+ hours using different host platforms and other possible solutions to no avail.
